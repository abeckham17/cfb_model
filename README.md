# cfb_model
 - I developed this model with two classmates for a project in my Intro to Statistical Methods and Data Analysis class. 
 - The goal of the model was to predict a team's record using from context independent team stats
 - For the project, I prepared the data, built a model, and received help from two classmates in wroting the paper on the model
